Please find within our software engineering project for COMP30830. The goal of this project was to create a functioning web application that reads data collected by the team from public API's and collate that into useful and readable user facing application. The project focused on the availability of bikes that are part of the dublin bikes scheme, as well as the weather and details associated with each station. Over a two month period, data was collected to create a predictive algorithm that offers the user an estimated number of bikes from an inputted day and time.
