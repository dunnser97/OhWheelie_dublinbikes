Please find within our software engineering project for COMP30830. The goal of this project was to create a functioning web application that would read data collected by the team from public API's and collate that into useful and readable information. The project focused on the availability of bikes that are part of the dublin bikes scheme. It compared this availability and with weather to try provide an estimate on the total available in the future also.
